    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! this is Anupam Anand.I'm originally from Bokaro steel city ,jharhand and been living here for decade now.
         I am working in html and css for the first time and this particuar code is my first project on html and I am very excited about it,though
           .I got to know about this amazing program called <br><strong>"30 Days of web Development"</strong> in which in month one will be able to learn so much about web development and it is turning out to be amazing and very productive.
       currently I am  in graduation 2nd year from kiit university form cs branch.
       I love to code and my aim is to invent something that can help people as much as possible.
       I believe one should always do the hard work and and don't think anything else that can distract you and <b>Never Cheat Yourself</b></p></center>
